ok so for characters you put the characters lua files in a folder named after the .hscript File name
for global you just put an lua script in it and it'll load
for stages same as characters but open up the file and its based on the "name" variable inside of it
same goes for songs just make sure its got the caps from the json file

note that this uses psych 0.6.3's lua so its pretty basic rn
